# Maze Generator

An example of a simple maze generator built with the awesome [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/).

**Live Demo** [https://cahilfoley.github.io/maze-generator/](https://cahilfoley.github.io/maze-generator/)

This example uses a depth-first search pattern and implements recursive backtracking for 100% coverage of the grid.

The implementation is written with modern javascript features, if you are confused by the `.mjs` extension there is an explanation [here](https://gist.github.com/thomasboyt/e8cccee512cb29989454a32e52ad831b) and some general information on ES modules [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).
